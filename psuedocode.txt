index.html:
a entry text appears saying "Welcome"
two buttons under welcome, new game or load game
new game will set everything to zero load game will read local data to adjust items, total score, and mana gems

game.html:
a monster with a health bar above it
on the bottom of the screen is no of mana gems
bottom right is an icon which when clicked takes you to store.html
when mouseover above the health bar, mana gems icon, and store icon you get a short about
when you click on the monster, depending on your equipment you do x damage, you also get x mana gem.
so health goes down by x, total score goes up by x, mana gems go up by x
when the monster dies you get its total health as mana gems and a new monster spawns

store.html:
contains the three weapons with the first already unlocked
contains consumables that multiply or add to x
contains NPCs that do auto damage
when mouseover you get a short about me 
when you click you buy the item, giving it to you and also decreasing your mana gems by the cost

main mechanics:

Damage(x): x starts at 0. the base unlocked weapon adds +1 to x. other weapons also add damage by 10s (1, 10, 100). two potions in store. when is a multiplicative effect on x, the other is an addition

Mana gems: Damage adds to managems. so managems will be += x. when purchasing anything mana gems will be subtracted by the cost.

Total score: it is the total damage being done. so exactly calculated like the managems but unable to be subtracted.

health: a limit on the amount of damage the monster can take, once it exceeds the amount the monster dies.

store: a store with weapon upgrades and potions. it checks if you are able to afford the item with current mana gems, if yes it subtracts the cost from your mana gems. NPCs do auto damage

monster: the object you click to damage. once it dies (health =< 0) is replaced by a new monster.
